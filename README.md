**Track Every Click. Master Every Metric.**

**Doubly** is a powerful link shortener and analytics platform designed to give you deep insights into how your links are performing. Simply provide a URL, and Doubly generates a smart proxy link. When users click this link, they’re seamlessly redirected to your original destination—while Doubly captures detailed data about the click event.

From device type to geographic location, Doubly collects and organizes valuable metrics, presenting them in a clear, user-friendly dashboard. With intuitive filtering options, you can quickly drill down to the data that matters most. For example, you can effortlessly view how many users from the Americas (excluding the United States) clicked your link last week using Android devices—no complex queries required.

Doubly empowers you to make informed decisions based on real user behavior, all in just a few clicks.
